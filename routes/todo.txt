index route contains mongoose code,
will probably want to move this to its own directory for other data channels / API

considering writing a middleware function to handle the seperate API files

router.get('/summons', ***middleware*** ,function(req, res, next) {
});

middleware{
  makes calls to database which has already been queried.
  query uses lazy loading of the next tree level but caches what it can
    -perhaps check last login date and track changes since
      last_modified > last_login
    -save lookups to localdb and run refresh on the changes? with minimongo
    -would need to write a module to perform the queries and update locally
}
